## Overview
This is a first look at a completed weather dashboard, where you're able to look at the 5-day forecast of any city. It even features a type of weather detector, meaning sunny weather would generate a different color than rainy weather. I hope you enjoy!
## Html changes
Coded the basic structure of the site in HTML, where I was able to craft each section of the site.
# CSS changes
Added few CSS stylings since HTML contained bootstrap link sources.
